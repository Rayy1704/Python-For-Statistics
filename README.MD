<h2>ES-111 Project: Python For Statistics</h2>

<h3>##Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing data <br>related to ES-111 students' marks. The project focuses on providing basic<br>statistics and various graphical representations of the data</p>
<h3>##Libraries Used in the Project:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>pandas:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Data handling, reading CSV file, and organizing data into a DataFrame.</li>
      <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Enables data exploration, manipulation, and analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>matplotlib.pyplot:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Visualization of data through various types of charts including line charts, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.</li>
      <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Provides tools for generating and customizing different types of plots, aiding in understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>random:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Generation of random numbers within a specified range.</li>
      <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Useful for statistical simulations or demonstrations, enhancing the versatility of the analysis conducted in the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>##Functionalities Implemented:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Reads data from a CSV file containing ES-111 students' marks.</li>
  <li>Calculates basic statistics such as mode, mean, median, range, standard deviation, variance, and covariance.</li>
  <li>Generates random numbers within a specified range.</li>
  <li>Visualizes data through different types of charts including line chart, scatter plot, histogram, bar chart, and pie chart.</li>
</ol>
<h3>##Learning Journey: From Course to Project</h3>
<p>Embarking on the journey to develop the ES-111 Project, I initially sought to bolster my skills by
enrolling in the Python for Beginners course offered by the University of Michigan(Course Certificate provided),from which i made my notes(Provided). Through the course,
I gained a comprehensive understanding of Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization techniques,
laying a solid foundation for undertaking this project. As I delved into developing the ES-111 Project, I encountered
challenges that encouraged me to apply the concepts and techniques learned during the course in a practical setting. From
handling data with pandas to visualizing it using matplotlib.pyplot , every step of the project provided valuable learning opportunities.
By completing this project, I've not only honed my technical skills but also cultivated problem-solving abilities and gained confidence in 
tackling real-world data analysis tasks. Moving forward, the knowledge and experience gained from this project will undoubtedly serve as a
cornerstone for my future endeavors in Python programming and data analysis, empowering me to take on more complex projects and contribute
meaningfully to the field.</p>
