<h3>##Functionality</h3>
<h4>The code performs the following functionalities:</h4>
<h5>
1.Reads data from a CSV file containing ES-111 students' marks.<br>
2.Calculates basic statistics such as mode, mean, median, range, standard deviation, variance, and covariance.<br>
3.Generates random numbers within a specified range.<br>
4.Visualizes data through different types of charts including line chart, scatter plot, histogram, bar chart, and pie chart.<br>
